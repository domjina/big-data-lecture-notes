\underline{Problems with parallelism} \\

\underline{count nums of each word in docs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Seriel solution: create counter and update as we scan through
    \item Process both docs at same time and add counters together as final step
    \item Additional time merging results from pipeline
    \item If on different machines, we need to include network transfer time
    \item As architecture becomes more complex, we need orchestration
\end{itemize}

If a machine fails mid process, we need to reallocate the task. \\ 
This involves getting another copy of the data that the process was using. \\ 
The restart the task. \newline

\underline{What happens if the master fails?} \newline
What happens if we lose track of one of the machines? I.e. network error \newline

\underline{What we need to consider when creating parallel architecure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Load balancing
    \item Overheads
    \item orchestration
\end{itemize}
 \newpage

\underline{Map reduce paradigm/framework} \newline
\underline{Basic ideas:} \\
Map(Key1, Value1) $\rightarrow$ List[$<$Key2, Value2$>$] \\
Reduce(Key2, List[Value2]) $\rightarrow$ List$<$Value2$>$ \\

Map a word to a list of documents that have that word - reverse index \newline

Map example: Get words and count\\
Reduce example: sum the words\\

\underline{Hadoop: open source version of Map \& Reduce made by yahoo} \\

\underline{Hadoop} is an implementation fo the map reduce in java along with a \underline{distributed file storage} called \underline{HDFS} \\
\underline{HDFS} - Hadoop distributed file system \\

\underline{Hadoop compute:}\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Client - Software that the client uses to submit work to the hadoop cluster
    \item Job Tracker - Recieves work and uses the name node to identify where data is located. Assigns work to task trackers
    \item Task Tracker - Executes map and reduce tasks
\end{itemize}

\underline{Hadoop HDFS}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Name node - tracks location of all data held on the HDFS
    \item Data Node - Handles storage access of the local files on the machine
\end{itemize}

\underline{hadoop versioning: W3-01} \newline
